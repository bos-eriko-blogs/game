description: Why do they even do it?

For real, though. Why do people even do it? It takes the fun out of the game. I recently saw this video and it's really annoying. They should stop doing these kind of things. It's a good thing that Apex doesn't rewards kills in the game. If they do that it'll be filled with cheaters more.
