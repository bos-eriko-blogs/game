I've been playing Apex Legends on PS4 lately and, damn, this game is good! It's a BR game similar to PUBG but here you have your own character with a unique skill. There's always a squad of 3 so you can make combos for your team. I haven't played that much compared to others. I haven't even reached level 30 yet. As for the times that I've won and became a champion. I've only done it twice.
